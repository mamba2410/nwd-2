# New Working Directory 2

This is a script designed to help create new projects.

Designed around C but intended to support C, C++ and Fortran 90 out of the box.
LaTeX is also included but that might be iffy.

It should be highly customisable, and adding new languages should be as simple as adding a new directory in the `languages/` directory.
Editing the directory path and adding new licenses should also be very simple to do.

## Installation
There are plans to be able to install this with xbps, but wight now theres nothing.
For this to work correctly, place the repo in `$XDG_DATA_HOME/nwd` and move the script `nwd` to wherever you like, preferably somewhere in your `$PATH` variable.
I most likely won't add any other installation support past manually installing it and with xbps.
