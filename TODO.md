# TODO
- Handle main input
- Error check and sanitise main input
- Handle input flags + error check (just parse for now)
	- Split into args and make a switch-case inside a for loop?
	- Google it or look at how [lolcat](https://github.com/jaseg/lolcat/blob/master/lolcat.c) did it in c.
	- Have a help string/usage thing when parsing fails.
- Generate basic directory structure. Put structure in external file so users can edit as they like.
- Set language based on the `-l` flag
	- use `ls languages/` to get all available languages.
	- have as much language detection/aliases be outside the script as possible
- Pass off to language-specific script based on language
	- Pass through checked project name on `$1`
	- Pass through init files flag on `$2`

	- [Help with headers.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4569825/sed-one-liner-to-convert-all-uppercase-to-lowercase)
- Implement makefile (or just copy over from old one)
	- Build date/numbers.
		- Build number should be saved as `metadata/<filename>.bn`
		- Build date should be saved as `metadata/<filename.bd`
	- Submodules
	- [Log files](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54933242/how-do-i-make-a-makefile-to-log-both-command-and-its-output-to-a-file)
	- Auto compile/detect submodules? Flag inside the makefile?
	- make clean

- Set git remote repository. Try to clone first? If failed, exit, else carry on as normal.
- Handle C++ language
- Handle Fortran-90 language
- Handle recognition, error check and generation of license.
