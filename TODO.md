# TODO
- Handle main input
- Error check and sanitise main input
- Handle input flags + error check (just parse for now)
- Generate basic directory structure. Put structure in external file so users can edit as they like.

- Pass off to language-specific script based on language
- Init file alterations
- Implement basic makefile (or just copy over from old one)
- Set git remote repository. Try to clone first? If failed, exit, else carry on as normal.
- Handle C++ language
- Handle Fortran-90 language
- Update more of the makefile.
- Handle recognition, error check and generation of license.
- Handle readme, manual and design doc. Readme and manual should have project name as title. Design doc is static.
